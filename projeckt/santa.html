            edited with transporting the legend of Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas) to New Amsterdam (now New York City), along 
            with the custom of giving gifts and sweets to children on his feast day, December 6. The 
            current depiction of Santa
             Claus is based on images drawn by cartoonist Thomas Nast for Harper’s Weekly beginning
              in 1863. Nast’s Santa owed much 
             to the description given in the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (also known as “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”),
              first published in 1823. The image was further defined by the popular Santa Claus advertisements created for the 
              Coca-Cola Company from 1931 by illustrator Haddon Sundblum. Sundblum’s
             Santa was a portly white-bearded gentleman dressed in a red suit with a black belt and white fur trim,
              black boots, and a soft red cap..</p>

        <h2>why santa gift you present</h2>
        <p>While my elves are busy wrapping presents 
            and loading them into my sleigh, I wanted to take a moment to 
            try to answer a question many of you may 
            have: why Santa Claus
             gives gifts?
            Gift-giving is a beautiful tradition that brings joy to the lives of
             our loved ones, especially the young. Nothing beats the sight of a kid beaming 
             with excitement as they tear into their Christmas presents..</p>
